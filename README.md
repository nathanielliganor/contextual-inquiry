The project provides a comprehensive overview of Michigan's pressing challenge: an aging water system infrastructure coupled with a critical lack of awareness among residents, particularly in vulnerable communities. This lack of awareness intersects with socio-economic factors, creating a diverse set of infrastructure and information needs. The presentation highlights the detrimental impact of misinformation, leading to confusion, skepticism, and a decline in trust in public officials, reminiscent of past crises like the Flint Water Crisis.

The data collection process draws attention to the shared perspective among public service officials and academic professionals - the goal of water infrastructure is to remain hidden from the public eye. Emphasis is placed on the need to educate the public and garner support for infrastructure improvement. Critical reflection reveals limitations in localized perspectives, potential biases based on personal experiences, and challenges in obtaining constructive insights from the public.

Moving forward, the project suggests grassroots efforts to address aging infrastructure at the local level due to unreliable state and federal funding. It advocates for public education, combating misinformation, and fostering engagement even in non-crisis situations. The need for cooperation among all stakeholders is underscored to tackle the complex issue of aging infrastructure. Additionally, the emphasis is placed on common-sense education focusing on water conservation, maintaining water quality, and the role of individuals in preserving water resources. Overall, the project outlines a holistic approach to bridge the education gap, combat misinformation, and improve Michigan's water infrastructure through community engagement and collaborative efforts.
